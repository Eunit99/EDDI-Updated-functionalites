# **EDDI-Updated-functionalites**
An updated features added to EDDI


# **How to Make Use of the Themes:**
This is a guide on how to use/change themes. The themes are located in `themes.css` can only be activated/changed
manually by the admin for now.

##### The list of themes to be used are:

##### 1. The `Default` theme
##### 2. `Snipcart` theme
##### 3. `Creative` theme
##### 4. `Mangrove` theme
##### 5. `Elle` theme
##### 6. `Torn` theme
##### 7. `Tareq` theme
##### 8. `Baobla` theme
##### 9. `Conseil` theme

# **Switching between Themes:**

**To do that, it is simple.**
1. Open the `styles.css` file in your text editor
2. Press `CTRL+H` to do an all replace
3. Replace all `--THEME_NAME__` to a theme name of your choice. Ex: `--default__` to say `--snipcart__`
4. Then press `CTRL+ALT+ENTER` on the text editor to do an all replace.
5. Then press `CTRL+S` to save your file
6. Refresh the pages on your browser to view the changes.

### **Note:**
You will have to reconfigure the chat `settings.js` file to work with EDDI's environment (just like it was done the last
time); I just use this example of the chat flow to demonstrate the chat functionality.
