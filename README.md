# How to Make Use of the Themes
 This is a guide on how to use the themes. The themes are located in `themes.css` can only be activated/changed manually by the admin for now. 

##### The list of themes to be used are:

##### 1. The `Default` theme
##### 2. `Snipcart` theme
##### 3. `Creative` theme
##### 4. `Mangrove` theme
##### 5. `Elle` theme
##### 6. `Torn` theme
##### 7. `Tareq` theme
##### 8. `Baobla` theme
##### 9. `Conseil` theme


To do that, it is simple. 
1. Open the `chat-window.css` file
2. Press CTRL+H to do an all replace in your text editor
3. Replace all `var(--default__` to a theme name of your choice. In this case, let us say `var(--mangrove__` 
4. Then press `CTRL+ALT+ENTER` on the text editor to do an all replace.
5. Then press `CTRL+S` to save your file
6. Refresh page on your browser to view the changes. The changes are only see on the `index.html` file of the `chat window` and `index.html` file of the `overlay page`

### Note: 
You will have to reconfigure the chat `settings.js` file to work with EDDI's environment (just like it was done the last time); I just use an example to demonstrate the chat functionality.
